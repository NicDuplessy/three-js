# three-js

Three JS application for generating a shirt with a logo or a full texture image.

React application that allows user to change shirt color or texture and upload personal images to use as shirt logo/texture.

This application also uses OpenAI API for Dall-E to set prompts for the AI to generate images. (This function will not generate any images due to OpenAI new payment structure on images, but server is working as intended).
